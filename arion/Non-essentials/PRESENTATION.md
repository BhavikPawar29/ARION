# 🛡️ ARION - Hackathon Presentation

## Slide 1: Title
**ARION**
**Autonomous Risk Intelligence & Optimization Network**

*Built to notice what others overlook.*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Current Challenges in Portfolio Management:
- ❌ **Reactive, not proactive** — Most tools alert AFTER losses occur
- ❌ **Information overload** — Too many metrics, no clear action
- ❌ **Siloed analysis** — Risk, sentiment, and forecasts analyzed separately
- ❌ **Manual monitoring** — Requires constant human attention

### The Gap:
**No intelligent system that autonomously monitors, analyzes, and advises on portfolio risk in real-time.**

---
